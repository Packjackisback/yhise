###Chapter 1: On piracy

Piracy. You love it or hate it. 
It’s the idea of illegally copying and distributing software, or really any digital content. 
Greedy companies, making you pay for things that should be free, sucking every last penny out of their often bad content. 
Piracy is ethical.
I’m going to show you how to take back your right to free software, eBooks, and much more.

Section 1
**Quick Disclaimer**
This is for educational purposes only, much of this is technically illegal.
You may also run the risk of your computer being infected, and your data being stolen. Your fault, not mine.

eBooks:
There are many ways to get the ebooks you deserve, but by far the most reliable and safe way is  through irc chats.

First you must download a irc client. The one I’m using is Hexchat, but any should work fine.

Once you open it up, pick your name, and scroll through the list of servers to IRCHighWay.
(irc.irchighway.net)

Before you join it, you must click edit and check Accept invalid SSL certificates.

Click close, and then hit connect.

You want to type /join #ebooks

Now type @search <book>

It should send you a file. Save it.

##Note: It may not download the first time, just press up and search again if necessary. 

Now extract the .zip file you’ve got. Open the txt, and find the book you want.

Select the entire thing you want, from ‘!’ to the end of the file. It should look like this 

!dragnbreaker Andrews, Wendy May - Mayfair Mayhem 01 - The Duke Conspiracy.epub

Now send it in the chat.

Wait a few seconds, and you will receive the file.

If the book isn’t found (not among search results), you can try finding it on archive.org, or use some random torrent website.

Here’s a few websites you can find free ebooks on.

mobilism.me (requires free account)
libgen.fun (textbooks, manuals, and magazines)
Ebookee.com
ebookbb.in
ikindlebooks.com 
audiobookbay.net
pdfdrive.com
3lib.net (Seized)
sci-hub.tw (Technical papers)
oceanofpdf.com
ebook-hunter.org/Books/
pdfget.com
sanet.st/full/
the-eye.eu/public/Books/
Trantor.is
mywarez.org (Requires registration) (pretty great)
annas-archive.org

Hopefully you have found the book you want. Books are important and shouldn’t cost money online. Piracy for ebooks can contribute to a smarter more educated society. Never buy a book again!

Software:
A lot of paid software tends to be better, but developers are greedy and lock it behind a paywall. Software is cracked so it is obtainable, unfortunately some evil bastards will often add malware. The pirate bay is often full of malware, so stay away from that. You will likely end up with ransomware or some keylogger.

Now. Before we start you 1000% need a trusted and reliable antivirus. This will slow down your pc a little bit, but you may want to get more than 1, just in case, or back up your files.

Ahnlab is perhaps one of the best right now, but it costs a ridiculous 6.99 per month.

Bitdefender free is a pretty well rounded av, and Avira free is a bit slower but better at detecting virii.
If you have a potato pc like me, you may want to go for Kapersky, as it is a lot faster.

You should also install an ad blocker, and vpn. Their is a lot written on this, so I’ll leave you to do your own research.


Now, to the good part.
########## SOFTWARE ##########

First, I’m going to start with the torrent links. I’ll be using bittorrent for this bit, specifically the linux port qbittorrent. Bittorent has a virus.  More below in tools section.
As an example I’ll be using 1337x.to  , and skipping tthe av check bc you guys probably have different antiviruses.

Start your vpn, go to the website, and find the file you want. Click on the orange button labeled Torrent Download, and click on any of the orange mirrors, but I recommend torrage. If none work just hit the magnet link, and it should open it in bittorrent. If a torrent downloads hit ctrl-o to open and it should download.

I’ll list where to get the cracked software, or warez.
 %%%%%% TORRENTS %%%%%%

rutracker.org (Acc required, free, awesome)
1337x.to
ftuapps.dev
monkrus.ws (Relatively safe, not best selection)
rerbg.to

%%%%%%% DOWNLOADS %%%%%%%%
Much simpler, when you find a file just download  it.
You still want to use a vpn, antivirus and adblocker

I hope you’ve found what you’re looking for, and if you didn’t you can try IRC.

Servers with warez:
rizon
scenep2p
xeromem
mircphantom
abjects
undernet

Just look up the server domain, it isn’t hard to find.

######## MUSIC ############

Music is pretty much free on smth like spotify, just install an ad skipper.

If you want to download music, for god knows why, you can either download from youtube, or go to a general torrent site, like pirate bay or 1337x.

It’s not that hard.

A god send fo downloads is the slav art divolt server. Divolt is a fork of revolt, a open source optimized non central hosted alternative to discord. TBH it’s better. Anyway, create an account at divolt.xyz , and go to this invite:
https://divolt.xyz/invite/TStW7rFg

This will tell you the current domain of the slavart drive, which at the time of writing is slavart.gamesdrive.net   <--- This will have 90% of the songs you need, and is easy to use and fast.
If you really want some more specialized websites, I’ll list them, but don’t expect too much.

$$$$$$$$$$ Download Managers $$$$$$$$$$$$$$

These are useful for DDL sites. Download managers such as these are meant to help to speed up downloads, typically by increasing the number of connections to the server or attempting to split the download into chunks. They are also especially handy when grabbing multiple links at once, which is typical with DDL sites, where they'll split up large downloads into multiple small .rar parts, as well as bypassing captchas and eliminating the risks of clicking on the wrong download button on various file hosts. They also help with resuming paused or timed out downloads which your browser may not be able to do in some cases.

JDownloader2 - Download manager that supports downloading from a variety of file-hosts. Supports downloading video from many websites.
Internet Download Manager (IDM) - Paid download manager that supports downloading from a variety of file-hosts. Supports downloading video from many websites. Use the free trial, then when the trial is nearing its end, simply reset the trial with this.
(https://github.com/J2TEAM/idm-trial-reset) Alternative method here. (https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/fe8l96/idm_trial_reset_not_working_anymore_what_now/fjmxjdk/)
XTREME download manager - Another very nice download manager
pyLoad - Lightweight download manager written in python. Managed through a WEB UI.
aria2 - Commandline-based download utility.

### Appendix I: Privacy

Why should I care about privacy, I have nothing to hide / not a criminal? - Do you want the whole world staring through your webcam, shifting through and posting your personal photos, informing the world of your bank number & password, and privacy is an important piece of democracy, and ensures our freedom of expression, association, and assembly. 

Now. Imagine all of your deepest darkest secrets. Your searching for another job, maybe, maybe you’re cheating on your wife. Now imagine everybody having that info, from your boss, wife, and police, to criminals bent on destroying your life. 

Now. How can you fix this issue?

First: Passwords: Nothing can get your account hacked and your data stolen faster. If you have a password listed in the attached file (passlist.txt), your account is most likely already compromised, and you need to change all of passwords for EVERYTHING. You want an account with at least 10 characters, including a near equal spread of symbols, numbers, lowercase and capitol letters. Don’t use a password manager unless it is one of the ones listed (No Google password manager because if your account is compromised they get all of your passwords)

Bitwarden - Free, open source, password breach reports, multi- factor authentication, self hosting, server side encryption :(

KeePassXC - Open source, available on all platforms, and has browser extensions for all main browsers. There also is unofficial apps for android and ios (eww)  2fa, offline, client side encryption :) 

1Password - Unfortunately not open source, but pretty well respected. Has built in autofill, 

Second: Have a public account. No, not like sharing your life to complete strangers. Have an account (that still has a strong password), that’s only used for business or official things. 
Don’t use this for anything private and not absolutely requiring it. 

Third: No social media. Not all of them, but certain social medias are extremely unsafe, including but not limited to:

Almost all of them. Only a few are “safe” and still are pretty awful about user data. Open source tends to be better, and alternatives are often available. For instance Discord sells basically all user data, but an open source alternative that doesn’t sell your data is called revolt (revolt.chat), and it’s open source and on github, and actually runs smoother. It lacks a few features, but is pretty efficient, and looks good.  You might think, how is discord selling your data bad? Realize that this includes your email, when and where and on what device you use and log on from, your phone #, and much more. It might even sell your chat data. Do you really want your gc leaked to not just your friends, but hungry vulture-like advertisers, and worse, government officials. Now. Think of how bad discord is, and apps like instagram, snapchat, twitter, and don’t even get me started on facebook, are at least 10 times worse. They sell all of the above on the list of your data, from photos to private chats to your address, these scumbags sell it all. The worst thing is, many teens today mindlessly post personal important information without a second thought for all the world to see. The internet and news sites
